h2. N.B:

  * In some places the 'map' variable is directly referenced and will cause issues if there are two maps
    or a map with a name other than map. Suggest making the Google::Map avaible globally through some interface.
     
  * Track the "maps" that the user has created by keeping a hash by name, the main map being called "main".
    Other objects can then refer to these maps using the abstraction

h2. Intuitive Marker updates

  * The :draggable logic for 'hiding' the info window when the marker is 'picked up'
    can perhaps detect if an info window was open and then 'show' it again when the marker is 'dropped',
    this seems intuitive

h2. Eschaton general

  * When in ruby and ruby objects are availble return those, otherwise return their javascript equivalents in the form of strings.
    i.e if map.center = Google::Location return that, otherwise return 'map.getCenter()'. This will make sure "predictable" results occur when the generated
    script executes
 
h2. Eschaton dev
 
  * See Google::Circle and refactor into various 'shape' classes.
    Rename draw_circle in eschaton.js to 'draw_shape' and metafy as need be!

  * Eschaton generator to generate eschaton slices in the 'lib' folder.

h2. Eschaton Enhancments

 * map.add_lines :from => location, :to => [other_location, another_location], :thickness => 10, :opacity => 0.7

 * Map#add_geo_rss(url) : Render a geo rss feed on the map
  
 * Keyboard navigation needs focus on div, sort this, how ???
 
h2. Higher level ideas, trippy shit

 * Have a concept of 'marker' groups, in which you can add markers to these groups and perform actions on the groups.
   Say we have two groups, 'Wikipedia' and 'Flickr' and marker in each group. We could then say stuff like
   wikipedia_group.show && flickr_group.hide or wikipedia_group.hide && flickr_group.show.
    
   Basically to get a handle of groups of markers and perform actions on them.
   Perhpas we could treat all overlays like this(markers, lines etc)

 * Abstract the concept of a "route", have the abilty to add "Waypoints" to the route that can have a marker, tooltip and info 
   window etc. This should be an eschaton plugin
 
 * Integrate with google spreadsheets so that spreadsheet data with a 'name' and 'location' column can be shown on the map,
   that would be slick to show people!
