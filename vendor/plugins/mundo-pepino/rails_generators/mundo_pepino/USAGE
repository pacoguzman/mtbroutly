Description:
    Sets up MundoPepino in your Rails project in order to start writing 
    features in Spanish. After running this generator you will get a new 
    rake task called "caracteristicas".
    
    This also generates the necessary files in the "caracteristicas"
    directory.
    
    Also see the caracteristica generator, which you can use to generate 
    skeletons for new features in Spanish.
    
Examples:
    `./script/generate mundo_pepino`
