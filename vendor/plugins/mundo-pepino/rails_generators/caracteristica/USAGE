Description:
    Generates a skeleton for a new feature file written in Spanish (característica) that
    describes an standard resource management (currently only C and D of the CRUD).
    This generator should be used with moderation.
    See http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/wikis/feature-coupled-steps-antipattern
    for details about the dangers involved.

    It takes at least two arguments: the name of a model and its translation to Spanish.
    
    This generator can take an optional list of attribute pairs similar to Rails'
    built-in resource generator but adding also the field Spanish translation after the
    field type (see an example below). 

Examples:
    `./script/generate caracteristica Post Artículo` # no attributes
    `./script/generate caracteristica Post Artículo title:string:título body:string:cuerpo published:boolean:publicado`
